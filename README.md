### 📑 **Patient Health Management System**
This project is a JavaFX-based patient health management system designed to provide role-based access for patients, doctors, and nurses.   
The system facilitates secure authentication, appointment scheduling, medical record management, and doctor/nurse notes tracking.

The system ensures:

- Patient record management, including medical history, medications, and appointment details.
- Role-based access for patients (view records), doctors (update diagnoses), and nurses (assist with care documentation).
- File-based data storage, where each patient’s information is securely stored in .txt files.
- Seamless communication between doctors and nurses for medical evaluations and updates.
  
By leveraging JavaFX for the UI and text-based storage, this project offers a lightweight, standalone solution for managing patient health records efficiently.

### 📝 **Project Overview**
This system was developed as part of a CSE360 course team project, focusing on efficient healthcare data management.

The goal was to create a structured and user-friendly platform where:

- Patients can track their medical history and appointments.
- Doctors can update and review patient records.
- Nurses can assist in patient care and document observations.

The project leverages JavaFX for the UI and file-based storage instead of a database, making it lightweight and easy to manage.

### 🏥 **System Modules**

The Hospital Management System provides role-based access to different users, ensuring smooth and efficient medical record management. 

Below are the key modules and their functionalities:   

🔑 **User Authentication**   
- Patients can sign up and log in securely to access their medical information.

👩‍⚕️ **Doctor View**   
- View patient records including medical history and prescriptions.
- Add/update doctor's notes and physical exam results.

🩺 **Nurse View**   
- Access patient records, including allergies and precautions.
- Update nurse notes for patient care continuity.

🙍‍♂️ **Patient View**   
- Check their appointments, medical history, and insurance details.
- Update contact information for better communication.

📄 **File-Based Data Storage**   
- Instead of a database, this system stores patient records as .txt files, making it lightweight and easy to manage.
