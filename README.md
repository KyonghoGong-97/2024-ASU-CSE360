### 📑 **Hospital Management System**
This project is a JavaFX-based hospital management system designed to provide role-based access for patients, doctors, and nurses. The system enables secure authentication, appointment scheduling, patient record management, and medical notes tracking through an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

### 📝 **Project Overview**
This system was developed as part of a CSE360 course team project, focusing on efficient healthcare data management.

The goal was to create a structured and user-friendly platform where:

- Patients can track their medical history and appointments.
- Doctors can update and review patient records.
- Nurses can assist in patient care and document observations.

The project leverages JavaFX for the UI and file-based storage instead of a database, making it lightweight and easy to manage.
